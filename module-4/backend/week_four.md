## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's your favorite project management tool?
I like to use waffle board because it syncs up with github nicely. It also nice that it will automatically create a card for each pull request. 
2. Why do we create staging environments?
The staging environment is an added layer between development and production. It allows us a chance to go over our work before commit it. 
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
In my opinion a good readme should have detailed instructions on how to setup your projects. Additionally a good readme will detail exactly what was used to build the project. 
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues? 
I will make sure that at the very least a user is able to TAB through elements on the page.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
One basic security concern is clickjacking and you could prevent this by including specific headers in your http requests. 
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
Continuous integration is helpful because it allows you to create a virtual machine that will run your code based from scratch. It is another way of testing the entirety of your code on a machine that is not your local host. 
7. What are some continuous integration tools?
TravisCI and CircleCI.
